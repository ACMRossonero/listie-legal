### Using Listie

**Q: How do I add a dish?**  
A: Dishes tab → Tap "+" button → Fill in the details → Save.

**Q: What are ingredients for?**  
A: Ingredients automatically generate your grocery list. Add them if you want an automatic list, or leave blank if you just want the meal plan.

**Q: Can I add recipe links?**  
A: Yes! When creating a dish, there's an optional "Recipe URL" field. The link will appear in your meal plan for quick access.

**Q: How does anti-repetition work?**  
A: Enable it in the "List" tab settings. Listie will avoid dishes from your previous week when generating the new week.

**Q: Can I modify a confirmed meal plan?**  
A: Yes! Go to the "List" tab → Tap "Modify" → Change individual meals → The grocery list updates automatically.

**Q: How do I change the week start day?**  
A: List tab → Settings section → Week start → Pick your day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)

### Grocery List

**Q: How is the grocery list created?**  
A: Listie automatically compiles ingredients from all dishes in your confirmed meal plan, organized by category.

**Q: Can I add items manually?**  
A: Yes! In the "Grocery" tab, tap "Add an article" to add non-meal items (e.g., toilet paper, coffee).

**Q: Do manual items disappear when I create a new week?**  
A: No. Manual items persist across weeks. Check them off, uncheck, or delete as needed.

**Q: Can I check off items as I shop?**  
A: Absolutely. Tap any item to check it off. Tap again to uncheck.

### Data & Privacy

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Locally on your iPhone. Listie does NOT upload your meals, plans, or grocery lists to the cloud.

**Q: What happens if I delete the app?**  
A: All your local data (dishes, plans, lists) is deleted. Your subscription remains active (managed by Apple).

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Currently no, but this feature is on our roadmap. Email us if you need this urgently.

**Q: Does Listie track me?**  
A: No. We don't track you across apps or websites. See our Privacy Policy for details.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The app crashes when I try to generate a week.**  
A: Make sure you have at least 7 dishes added. If the issue persists, email us with your device model and iOS version.

**Q: My grocery list is empty.**  
A: Check that your dishes have ingredients added. No ingredients = no automatic grocery list.

**Q: I can't confirm my meal plan.**  
A: Ensure your week has at least one meal. If you're on "lunch only" or "dinner only" mode, you need 7 meals minimum.

**Q: The app won't open / is stuck.**  
A: Try force-quitting the app (swipe up from bottom) and reopening. If that doesn't work, restart your iPhone. If still stuck, email us.

**Q: How do I update Listie?**  
A: App Store → Updates tab → Find Listie → Tap "Update". We recommend always using the latest version.

### Account & Subscription

**Q: How do I check my subscription status?**  
A: iOS Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions → Listie. You'll see status and renewal date.

**Q: I canceled but was still charged.**  
A: Apple charges at the end of your billing period, not immediately upon cancellation. Access continues until then.

**Q: I subscribed but still see the paywall.**  
A: Try tapping "Restore Purchases" on the paywall screen. If that doesn't work, email us.

**Q: Can I get a discount / family plan?**  
A: Not currently, but we're exploring options. Email us to stay updated.
